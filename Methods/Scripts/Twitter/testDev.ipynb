    "\n",
    "### Things that need to be done    \n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] Set up skeleton for a nice object oriented approach. \n",
    "- [x] Figure out best way to get tweets.\n",
    "- [x] Data format\n",
    "- [x] Build class and funcs\n",
    "- [x] Figure out how to best count all requests in a session and make sure it's functional\n",
    "    - This is already built-in to searchtweets to some extent, so will use that.\n",
    "- [x] Make oneDay() fail safe (it's a bad idea to get the data and combine it within a single for, because if something goes wrong in an interation all the data from previous iterations will be lost if something goes wrong).\n",
    "    - Getting a whole week instead\n",
    "- [x] Change oneDay() to oneWeek().    \n",
    "- [x] Save metadata for the payloads (i.e. self.most_recent, self.oldest, self.timeCovered, rs.total_results + other?)\n",
    "    - Seach tweets already saves some sort of log, print this to file with the appropriate name.  \n",
    "- [ ] More tests on oneWeek(): currently it sometimes returns an empty Stream sometimes, it might be due to bad handling of rate limits by searchtweets?\n",
    "- [ ] Updated export and loading to be compliant with the new folder structure. \n",
    "- [ ] See why df3 different size than what we get with oneWeek(). Test in intervals > 15 min, my suspicion is that it's bad handling of rate limits by searchtweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rate Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "- 10,000,000 Tweets per month (resets on the 19th of each month). \n",
    "- 300 requests/15 minute window, with 500 Tweets/request:\n",
    "    - 150,000 tweets/15min \n",
    "    - 600,000 tweets/hour\n",
    "\n",
    "### How many tweets to get?\n",
    "- Period covered is: Oct 23rd - July 30th (-ish)\n",
    "    - ~ 280 days\n",
    "    - ~ 6720 hours\n",
    "    - If we get 1000 tweets per hour: $6,720,000 * 2$. \n",
    "    - That's very little in terms of space, but might take quite a while for it to go through sentiment analysis.\n",
    "    - It would take ~22 hours to get the whole data (due to rate limits).\n",
    "    - However, it's unlikely that our queries would return anywhere near 1,000 results/hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best way to get tweets\n",
    "- Period covered is: Oct 23rd - July 30th (-ish)\n",
    "    - $n_h$ per hour/day\n",
    "    - $n_d$ per day (where $n_d$ would be ~ $n_h*24$)\n",
    "    - $n_w$ per week (where $n_w$ would be ~ $n_h*24 *7$)  \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- $n_w$ is probably the best options: \n",
    "    - can leverage functions built into *searchtweets* to avoid rate limit violations (e.g. exponential back-off).\n",
    "    - it's easy to select tweets in any given day/hour from these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data format\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single results call: **JSON to pd**.\n",
    "    - This is relatively straightforward with one minor complication, i.e. entries such as this:\n",
    "    <blockquote>{'newest_id': '1402310241992183808',\n",
    "  'oldest_id': '1402310139630211083',\n",
    "  'result_count': 100,\n",
    "  'next_token': 'b26v89c19zqg8o3fpdg7rbcqdq8stpgmibslekg3kxail'}\n",
    "    </blockquote>\n",
    "    - This is used by the wrapper to get the next lot of tweets if max_tweets > results_per_call, but will also always be the last entry in a result.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Multiple result calls: **pds in dict/dict-of-dict**. \n",
    "    - I am thinking the best way to store all the data would be a dict of dataframes, but will see how it works  \n",
