* Experimental survey designed to quickly and efficiently deploy data collected on how people’s lives have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
* Two-week data collection period in phases 3 and 3.1 which are the ones we're interested in (with a ~2 week data release lag). **Still called weeks, e.g. W18 for 28.10 - 09.11.20, in line with previous phases**
* Data collection for the current phase (3.1) began on **April 14, 2021**, with a first data release on **May 5, 2021** (next release ~ **May 19th, 2021**). 
* Online questionnaires: **n** varies, e.g. 59,000 for the 14.04 - 28.04 period of Phase 3.1; between ~58,000 and ~78,000 in Phase 3. 
* Data collection for previous phase (*3*) began on October 28, 2020 and ended March 29, 2021.
* The questions we are interested in should be identical (or sufficiently similar) in the two phases.
* Data and more info [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/data.html#phase3.1) and [here](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/technical-documentation/hhp/Phase3-1_Source_and_Accuracy_Week_28.pdf).
* Contains questions on **employment + vaccination**.

# Getting data tables (aggregate).

For employment we need tables 1 and 2 under *Employment Tables*. (e.g. https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/hhp/hhp18.html)

For vaccination (starting 06.01.21) we need table 5 under *Health Tables* (e.g. https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2021/demo/hhp/hhp22.html)

## Employment

### Employment1

Employment Status and Sector of Employment, by Select Characteristics: United States


**Phase 3:** "Have you, or has anyone in your household experienced a loss of employment income since March 13, 2020? "

![](table_details/emp1_p10.png)

**Phase 3.1 (current):** "Have you, or has anyone in your household experienced a loss of employment income in the last 4 weeks?"

### Vaccination

**Questions**:

* Phase 3.0:
  * "Have you received a COVID-19 vaccine?"
    * YES: "Did you receive (or do you plan to receive) all required doses?" 
    * NO: "Once a  vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is available to you, would you…" [Definitely get | Probably get | Probably NOT | Definitely NOT]
    
* Phase 3.1:
  * "Have you received a COVID-19 vaccine?"
    * YES: "Did you receive (or do you plan to receive) all required doses?" 
    * NO: "Once a  vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is available to you, would you…" [Definitely get | Probably get | Unsure about getting the vaccine | Probably NOT | Definitely NOT]

### Notes:

Each table has a standard error table associated with it. The details of how these were derived can be found in the *Technical documentation* available for each week in part, e.g. [Week 28](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/technical-documentation/hhp/Phase3-1_Source_and_Accuracy_Week_28.pdf).

The structure should be identical in most cases, so the same functions could be used to get these. Unsure at this point how we'd be using these so will not get them just yet.
