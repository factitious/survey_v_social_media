# Axios/Ipsos Poll

* Between 2 and 4 interviews/month (n ~= 1000)
* Contains questions on **employment + vaccination**.
* Data/topline/methods available through SEAN: https://covid-19.parc.us.com/client/index.html#/search ![](https://i.imgur.com/3UXNsax.png) or at [IPSOS](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2021-05/topline-Axios-Ipsos-Coronavirus-Index-W46.pdf)


## Getting data tables.

Data downloaded manually from SEAN. There doesn't seem to be a straightforward way to do this programmatically.
Both employment and vaccination are in the same file, but under different sheets.

For employment we need sheet *PPEMPLOY* (or *PPWORK*).
For vaccination we need sheet *Q73* ("How likely, if at all, are you to get the first generation COVID-19 vaccine, as soon as it's available?")

```{r}
rm(list = ls()) 

# Run the script to get datasets (i.e. relevant sheets from the "weekly" A/I data) 
# source("gettingAI.R", local = knitr::knit_global())

# If this was previously run, the data can be loaded using
load('/Volumes/Survey_Social_Media_Compare/Methods/Data/Surveys/Axios-Ipsos/Proc/AI_data.RData')
```

## Cleaning data tables.

```{r}
# Run the script to clean the datasets
# source("cleaningAI.R", local = knitr::knit_global())

# If this was previously run, the data can be loaded using
load('/Volumes/Survey_Social_Media_Compare/Methods/Data/Surveys/Axios-Ipsos/Proc/clean_AI_data.RData')
```

# Household Pulse Survey (HPS; US Census)

* Experimental survey designed to quickly and efficiently deploy data collected on how people’s lives have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
* Two-week data collection period in phases 3 and 3.1 which are the ones we're interested in (with a ~2 week data release lag). **Still called weeks, e.g. W18 for 28.10 - 09.11.20, in line with previous phases**
* Data collection for the current phase (3.1) began on **April 14, 2021**, with a first data release on **May 5, 2021** (next release ~ **May 19th, 2021**). 
* Online questionnaires: **n** varies, e.g. 59,000 for the 14.04 - 28.04 period of Phase 3.1; between ~58,000 and ~78,000 in Phase 3. 
* Data collection for previous phase (*3*) began on October 28, 2020 and ended March 29, 2021.
* The questions we are interested in should be identical (or sufficiently similar) in the two phases.
* Data and more info [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/data.html#phase3.1) and [here](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/technical-documentation/hhp/Phase3-1_Source_and_Accuracy_Week_28.pdf).
* Contains questions on **employment + vaccination**.

## Getting data tables.

For employment we need tables 1 and 2 under *Employment Tables*. (e.g. https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/hhp/hhp18.html)

For vaccination (starting 06.01.21) we need table 5 under *Health Tables* (e.g. https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2021/demo/hhp/hhp22.html)

```{r message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, include=FALSE}
# Run the script to get datasets 
# source("gettingHPS.R", local = knitr::knit_global())

# If this was previously run, the data can be loaded using
load('/Volumes/Survey_Social_Media_Compare/Methods/Data/Surveys/HPS/Proc/HPS_data.RData')
```

## Cleaning tables.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Run the script to clean the datasets
# source("cleaningHPS.R", local = knitr::knit_global())

# If this was previously run, the data can be loaded using
load('/Volumes/Survey_Social_Media_Compare/Methods/Data/Surveys/HPS/Proc/clean_HPS_data.RData')
```


```{r}

#   
# }

```



### Notes:

Each table has a standard error table associated with it. The details of how these were derived can be found in the *Technical documentation* available for each week in part, e.g. [Week 28](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/technical-documentation/hhp/Phase3-1_Source_and_Accuracy_Week_28.pdf).

The structure should be identical in most cases, so the same functions could be used to get these. Unsure at this point how we'd be using these so will not get them just yet.
