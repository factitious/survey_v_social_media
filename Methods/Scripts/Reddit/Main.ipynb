       "1643    I joined an app, I thought it was like Tinder but it’s much more inclusive and originally just for threesomes. I didn’t know that but after I joined, I started chatting to some guys and it was fun. I joined right before COVID so in February. I was upfront that I wasn’t really the app or bold type. Also didn’t mention I had no sexual experience but guys don’t ask they just want to see pics or talk about what they want to do with you. Point is I caught feelings for someone, I know that’s my fault. He kept asking to meet and I said no since I was being socially distant. He started taking longer to reply and the last time I spoke to him he wanted to meet up and I said yes after Labor Day. I didn’t hear back from him. I deleted my account and made a new one, it had been a good pastime what can I say. I did the free trail where you can see who likes you and he liked me. He started talking to me and I told him, hey it’s me. He said he was busy and forgot and that’s why he didn’t respond. On the app I don’t show my face, but one picture I had used on my old profile. So I thought he remembered.He also matched with me on another app. I told him I had tested negative for COVID and if he still wanted to meet. He said he hadn’t been tested because he hadn’t been going out and that we could meet next year when the vaccine came out. I was so embarrassed, I told him that. He tried to say he really wanted to but wasn’t meeting people right now. I hadn’t meet anyone in person and decided to take the risk because I knew he had been pretty cautious because of his job. I feel like an idiot, and am so embarrassed. I know if I hadn’t had told him who I was he would have asked to meet. He just wasn’t interested anymore but trying to be nice. Point in all my rambling, talking to someone online for over a month isn’t worth it. I got to talk about myself too much and I got to hear about him and it made me like him. Well as much as you can like someone you never met, more like having a crush when you are 12. I just feel so upset at myself. Should I have just meet him earlier and been more bold? I had planned on being less conservative this year and finally having sex. I was not abused, just raised in a religious household and that gave me a lot of shame. My birthday is coming up and it’s going to be another year well past the age to being a virgin, I am in my early 30s. I was pretty sure he would have been ok with it, so that’s the other reason I took it so hard. I just want to be like someone my age. I know some people say age is just a number but once you get older, you just get more scared.\n",
