       "'My belief that being friends with an ex is very rare, and even in those rarities there are many attempting to be friends and haven’t quite realized the ship they’re trying to salvage is already sunk. \\n\\nI happen to be in one of these situations. At this point the only options is ghosting, as bad as it sounds, it is the only healthy choice. I’m not the greatest person in the world I may even share some of the Narc traits my ex has, it could be one of the biggest reasons I feel I hate her. But it’s not the only reason by a long shot.\\n\\nShe’s reached out and I have reached out when I know I shouldn’t have. Anytime we connect now it’s usually me who starts an argument because shes doing and saying the same things that added to our inviability. She starts complaining about someone making her feel a certain way, there’s something for her to complain about constantly, and she still talks about her ex, comparing me to him, and I’m sitting there like wait wtf I don’t have to listen to any of the shit anymore, none of it. What makes me hate her aren’t these things, it’s how she justifies things. “I can’t let things go” “she’s not that person anymore” “she has depression” “her mom could die any day” “she’s feeling suicidal” “I should grow up, and be attentive and cut her slack because she has mental issues” “I’m the one not allowing us to be friends”. \\n\\nBottom line we’re both screwed up in many similar ways, what I don’t do though is hold other people accountable for things that go wrong or that I caused. A friend told her to leave and she wants to call me to vent about it, but I know already it’s because she wore out her welcome, she has this odd sense of entitlement, I myself can’t stand to be in her presence for too long, I’ve had to ask her to leave myself. She leaves the house late misses the bus, it’s because the busses never run on time. She gets fired, because no one at the job liked her and they all wanted her gone. When we first met, she told me about her first apartment and that she got evicted, but she has no idea how it happened, she did everything she was supposed to do. The most resent apartment the same thing happened this time I was living with her, before we moved in I quit my job. She continued to work, I kept the place clean I cooked every night, she came home everyday and chewed me out. It took me only a month to find employment, which almost immediately after I did she quit her job, I worked and came home every day to listen to her complain about how hard her day was, she showed me constantly, applications she’d put into jobs she’d never get she doesn’t have a diploma/ged this went on for four months during and after that time she complained about how my efforts were minuscule compared to hers. She’d say off the wall shit to me pride her self on being blunt and straightforward then tell me I owe her an apology because of how what I said made her feel. We lived together broken up for a while and she attempted therapy  after always saying “they can’t help me, they don’t know what they’re talking about”. She came home one day and says to me “can you believe this woman tried to tell me I have Borderline Personality Disorder? Waste of time I’m not going back”. : |  I’ve never met a more pretentious person in my life. I miss the fleeting fun we still sometimes have, but with out doubt over all I hate this woman I absolutely hate her, and I wish that I didn’t still have any love for her. \\n\\nShout out to anyone who’s been diagnosed or diagnosed themselves with any mental issue, and use it as an excuse to be a shitty ass piece of shit human being, we’re all fucking depressed we live in the US most of us have jobs we hate that we spend more time earning peanuts at than the reasons we’re working. I myself have been diagnosed but it’s not a fucking weapon, and it doesn’t just pop up in conversations, only me and one other person knows. You may not have created your issues, but unfortunately they are yours to deal with now, no one else’s, support is necessary but it’s pretty easy to abuse. Men and women mostly women guys tend to suffer in silence, it can be a wonderful thing to find a partner who’s your knight in shining armor, they’re stable, and they also have the capacity to fully take on all your issues, but it isn’t realistic.'"
