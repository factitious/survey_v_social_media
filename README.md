# Understanding comparisons between surveys and social media data.

New forms of data are continuously explored as a potential complement or replacement for traditional survey data. Previous research has shown mixed results. For example, social media data have been shown to predict elections and human behaviour but often these results failed to replicate. There is ongoing research into understanding what are the strengths and limitations of these new forms of data. 

This project compares attitudes towards employment and vaccination derived from surveys and new forms of data (i.e. Twitter and Reddit). The analyses will focus on understanding the degree to which the data sources are comparable and the impact of different analytical decisions on the results.
